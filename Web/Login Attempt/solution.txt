go to http://3.23.56.243:9001/

to see  if there is anything, I check the source code by viewing it.

ok, this login page tells me this is a SQL injection and yeah the webpage title also stated it. so I just use some classic SQL injection trick.

" OR "" = "


ah it doesn't work. what should I do?

Well, apparently you can't easily bypass without understand what is it inside the database. So, like everyone else I google and find something about it.

I found out using SQLMap which allows us to test what type of vulnerabilities are there in that website. 

by using this command:
sqlmap -u http://3.23.56.243:9001/login.php?id=1 --dbs

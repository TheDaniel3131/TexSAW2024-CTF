Using the same SQL data from the first misc challenge.

```SQL
SELECT SUM(od.quantity * od.subtotal) AS total_revenue
FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Games g ON od.game_id = g.game_id
JOIN Genres gn ON g.genre_id = gn.genre_id
JOIN Orders o ON od.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE gn.genre_name = 'Action'
AND YEAR(o.order_date) = 2023
AND g.game_id IN (
    SELECT g.game_id
    FROM Games g
    JOIN Genres gn ON g.genre_id = gn.genre_id
    WHERE gn.genre_name = 'Action'
    AND YEAR(o.order_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY g.game_id
    ORDER BY SUM(od.quantity * od.subtotal) DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 4 -- 5th most revenue-generating game
);

```

Ah I am an economist hahaha.

Okay but in all seriousness, if you are using phpMyAdmin you will encounter MariaDB error like this below

#1235 - This version of MariaDB doesn't yet support 'LIMIT & IN/ALL/ANY/SOME subquery'


so use this

```SQL
WITH RankedGames AS (
    SELECT g.game_id, SUM(od.quantity * od.subtotal) AS revenue
    FROM OrderDetails od
    JOIN Games g ON od.game_id = g.game_id
    JOIN Genres gn ON g.genre_id = gn.genre_id
    JOIN Orders o ON od.order_id = o.order_id
    WHERE gn.genre_name = 'Action'
    AND YEAR(o.order_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY g.game_id
    ORDER BY revenue DESC
    LIMIT 4, 1  -- 5th most revenue-generating game
)
SELECT SUM(od.quantity * od.subtotal) AS total_revenue
FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN RankedGames rg ON od.game_id = rg.game_id;
```
